            <br>
            <br>
          </h2>
          <p class="">This sentence out of the booklet 'Ethical principles for Technology‘, prepared by Dr. Matthew Beard and Dr. Simon Longstaff , caught my eye.&nbsp;
            <br>I never really gave the term ‚technology‘ that much thought because I knew what I associated it with and that seemed enough for me to understand it.&nbsp;
            <br>Technology is a tool, something material that you can grasp and use to manipulate our world with in order to serve some goal.&nbsp;
            <br>So, in essence, it is a means to an end.&nbsp;
            <br>But the authors went more into detail describing this way of thinking as seeing "the world as a set of problems to be solved, forces to be understood and measured and products to be collected, stored and used. Technological artefacts bring
            this way of thinking into being.“&nbsp;
            <br>This reminded me of a T-Shirt that I saw a friend of mine wear quite frequently. It says: “The world is breaking. Come fix it!“. After coming to the conclusion that some people might just like wearing their personal convictions and beliefs
            on trendy T-Shirts, I realised, reminded by this excerpt of the booklet, that it had the logo of Palantir on it, a software company that specializes in big data analytics. These realisations and thoughts did not just spark interest in me because
            their content seemed so foreign to me, but rather because it forced me to answer a question I actually did not have a clear answer to: </p>
          <h2 class="text-primary pt-3">What is technology?
            <br>
            <br>
          </h2>
          <p class="">Surprisingly enough, this question requires a somewhat philosophical answer. One of the most prominent philosophers of technology, Martin Heidegger, stated that technology is "a way of revealing“. To understand his statement, we have to take
            a look at Heidegger’s understanding of reality. He saw reality as not being absolute. Reality has to be seen in relation to time and culture, so reality is not just reality itself, but just 'reality for us‘. A particular relation to reality
            'reveals‘ reality in a specific way. And that is what brings us back to technology. Technology is a way of revealing the world where humans take power over reality. In contrast to the classic Greek understanding of 'making‘ as 'helping something
            come into being‘, technology ‚forces into being‘ and reveals our world "as raw material“. I could have gone down this rabbit hole of questions forever: What defines a way of thinking? What is a thought? What is reality? But instead I came
            up with my own interpretation of all these statements: Just as we as humans have ethical responsibilities, technological artefacts, which bring this way of thinking into being, must have ethical responsibilities. Our way of living and technology
            are so intertwined that it just seems natural to me that we project our desire for purpose and absolute control on these tools that seem to give us the power to shape and steer our world in the direction we set. I am skeptical of a mindset
            that is constantly seeing problems to which we humans allegedly have to find solutions for and viewing our world as a controllable, measurable product to serve human goals. But a way of thinking that forces us to understand our world, think
            in a creative way and apply our knowledge in order to overcome everyday problems hoping that living will be made a tiny bit easier everyday, is a way of thinking I aspire to adopt.
            <br>
            <br>So, maybe technology isn’t just my interest and passion.
            <i>It’s my way of thinking. </i>&nbsp;</p>
